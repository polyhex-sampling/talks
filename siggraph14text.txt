== Title

Good morning everyone.
I'll present you a new fast sampling method, because it's constructed on a tiling system.
And that can generate distribution arbitrary user specified spectra.
This work was made with ****** from LIRIS lab, ** from Stanford and * from Caltech.



== Problem Statement

Basically, sampling is taking discrete values -the sample- from an continuous function.
To best evaluate this function, we want that samples are equally distributed ## talk about discrepancy? ##
and to have a larger density of sample where in the important part of the function.
Finally, the characteristic of the distribution have a big impact on quality of the function evaluation ## variance, bias, noise, aliasing ##



== Why it is essential?

When you sample a function, there is two main issues.
First is the noise, that come with a lack of samples.
Second is the aliasing, that arise when regularities/pattern in the function interfer with regularities in the sampling distribution.



== Context
-- Regular sampling

To choose sample position, a straitforward approach is to take a sample a regular interval, leading to a rectangular grid distribution.
This method has the advantage of uniformly sample the whole space.
But it will produce strong aliasing artefact when the sampling frequency is under the Nyquist frequency.
The regularities of this distribution is visible in spectral domain as a grid of peaks.


-- Monte Carlo

At the opposite, we can choose the sample position randomly. This is also known as Monte Carlo method.
The advantage is that all frequency are equally sampled.
We can see this with the constant Fourier spectrum.
But this distribution doesn't garanty a good uniformy and create holes and heaps of samples.
This lead to noise in the evaluation of the function.



== Previous works: Advanced Methods
-- Poisson Disk

Since eighties, a lot of algorithm have been proposed to enhance the sampling quality for a constant number of samples.
The Poisson Disk methods, first proposed by Cook in 1986, also use ramdom sample position.
But to ensure a better uniformity, it add a constrain on the minimum distance between two points.


-- Optimization based

Another class of methods is based on optimization.
This methods core is the minimization of an energy function.
Currently, the best results in terms of quality are obtain by this kind of methods.
Notice that, in spectral domain, there is no peak of frequency, limiting aliasing artefacts.

All this methods use spatial characteristics to generate sampling.
And the quality of these samplings is mainly judge by the characteristics of their Fourier spectra. ## Blue-noise, anisotropy, no peaks ##



== Previous works: General Noise Methods

Since two years, some methods propose to define these spectral characteristics in order to generate the corresponding distribution.
This way, we can minimize the function evaluation error by using a distribution with ideal spectral characteristic for a particular application.
The major problem with these kind of methods is their very low speed.



== Previous works: Tile-based Methods

Most of advanced sampling methods require lot of computational power and thus are rarely used in applications.
Tile-based methods aim at reducing the sampling complexity while keeping good sampling characteristics.
The principle is to store the sampling distribution through a hierarchical and non-periodic tiling system.
Then the sampling is reconstructed by generating the tiling.

Here it is tiling of previous tile-based methods, red dots are the barycenters of each tiles.
If you look at the Fourier spectrum of these barycenters, there is a lot of peaks that express pattern and regularities in the barycenters distribution.
In the right part, we have circled all these peaks.
The issue here, is that even after optimizing this barycenters, the peaks will still remain because of the inherent regularities of the tiling.
This is the main problem we solved in our article.



== Previous works: Positioning

To sum up, we propose an algorithm as fast as previous tile-based methods that can generate sampling equivalent to best existing sampling methods in term of quality.
We can also control the distribution spectrum through general noise methods.



== Base lattice

We start from an hexagonal lattice that provide better anisotropy and simpler connectivity than rectangular lattice.
We combine it a recursive subdivision scheme based on centered hexagonal number.
From this base we can construct a hierarchical non-periodic tiling system...



== Polyhexes & Subdivision
-- Polyhexes catalog

By enumerating all possible fixed trihexes (that are group of three connected hexagons).

-- Subdivision rule

For each of this thihexes, we find a subdivision rule that produce lambda smaller trihexes out of one.
All of this form a closed an finite subdivision system.



== Comparison with previous works

If we analyse this new tiling system with the Fourier spectrum of its tiles barycenters, we see a better anisotropy due to hexagonal lattice and a greater variety of tiles.
But we still have pattern/regularities as shown by the spectral peaks circled in red.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: hex

To correct this, we build a pseudo-random lattice base on an hexagonal lattice.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: hextile

We group hexagon in hextiles.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: triple edge modifiers

And we define triple-edge modifiers.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: one TEM

Each of these triple-edge modifiers...



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: one TEM + words litteral

... are mode of three binary words.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: one TEM + random words

Each of this word are randomly set.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: TEM + random words

We define a finite set of random triple-edge modifiers that cover the plane through bi-periodicity.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: irregular hextile

This construction garantee an equal capacity of all irregular hextiles



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: irregular hextile lattice

We finally have a quasi-hexagonal lattice composed of irregular hextiles.



== Irregular Polyhex
-- Irregular Polyhexes catalog

As shown before, we can enumerate all possible fixed irregular trihexes on this lattice.

-- Irregular Subdivision rule

And for each of them, construct a subdivision rule.



== Comparison with previous works

When we compare this tiling with previous methods, we see that it's now free of spectral peaks and that it's almost isotropic.
This distribution is a good base to build a high quality sampling system.



== Sampling generation (video)

To construct sampling distribution we start with an irregular trihex, that we subdivide enough to the desired density.
From this tiling, we take the barycenters of all tiles.
It's give us our basic sample distribution with good spectral characteristics.



== Sampling optimization: offset vectors

To reach the desired spectral target, we need to optimize the barycenters.
This offsets vectors are enough to greatly model the spectrum to our desire.



== Sampling optimization: local optimization

In order to store the offset vectors, we define indices that represent the local configuration of trihexes.
We optimize all this indices and thus all possible local arrangement of sample.
Then the final offset vectors are stored in a lookup table.



== Sampling optimization: multiple spectral target

For different spectrum target, we have to compute a different lookup table.



== Results Blue noise

With this sampling system we are able to generate sample distribution equivalent to best state of the art blue-noise results.



== Results Step noise

We can also produce more specific distribution as with a general noise method.



== Results Forest

This spectral control allow to mimic existing distribution of a forest for example.



== Results Timing

In term of speed, we can generate more than a million points per seconds as previous tile-based methods.



== Results Tile-based

Compare to previous tile-based methods, we obtain a much better quality.



== Results Adaptive (video)

From the hierarchical nature of our tiling system, it is possible to generate adaptive sampling of a density function.



== Overall Pipeline

To resume the whole sampling system.
We have a big precomputation phase where we construct a set of subdivision rules that allow us to generate a hierarchical non-periodic tiling.
This tiling barycenters produce a basic sample distribution that is optimize to fit a particular spectral target.
The offset vectors obtain from this optimization are stored in a lookup table.

The runtime is very fast:
we only have to generate a tiling at the desired density;
Take barycenters of each tiles;
And apply the precomputed offsets vectors.



== Contributions

In this work, our contribution are:
A novel tiling system that is hierarchical, non-periodic and free of spectral peaks;
A novel sampling system that is fast, can generate adaptive distribution with a control over its spectral characteristics.
