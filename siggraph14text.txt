== Title

Good morning everyone.
I'll present you a novel tiled-based sampling method that can generate point distribution with arbitrary user-specified spectra.
This work is the result of collaboration of people from French lab CNRS-LIRIS, Stanford and Caltech.



== Problem Statement

Basically, sampling is a process of discretization of a continuous function.
Intuitively, we want the samples to be evenly distributed and to have a local density of samples proportional to the local value of the function.
Also, The characteristics of the distribution of samples have a big impact on the quality of further treatement applyed on the samples, such as reconstruction, integral evaluation, etc.



== Why is it essential?

For example, local lack of samples generates a noisy reconstruction.
Another issue is the aliasing, resulting from interference between regularities in sampling and regularities in the function.



== Context
-- Regular sampling

The simplest way to generate sample positions is to calculate a rectangular grid.
This method has the advantage of sampling the whole space uniformly.
But it produces strong aliasing artefacts when the sampling frequency is smaller than twice the characteristic frequency present in the function.
It is well-known that the Fourier transform of a rectangular grid is also a rectangular grid of peaks.

-- Random sampling

Another simple solution would be to choose random position for sample.
This way all frequencies are equally sampled, as can be seen by the constant Fourier spectrum.
But this distribution doesn't garanty a good uniformity and creates local holes and heaps of samples.
This lead to noisy images after reconstruction and/or integration.



== Previous works: Advanced Methods
-- Poisson Disk

Since niniteen-eighties, a lot of algorithms have been proposed to enhance the sampling quality for a constant number of samples.
In Poisson Disk methods, a ramdom sample position is chosen, while respecting minimum point-to-point distance constrain.
This method guarantees much better uniformity, compared to random sampling.

-- Optimization based

Another class of methods is based on optimization.
The core of these methods is the minimization of an energy function associated to the samples.
Currently, the best-quality sampling distribution are obtained with this class of methods.
Notice that, in spectral domain, there is no frequency peaks, thus limiting aliasing artefacts.

( All these methods use spatial characteristics to generate sampling.
The quality of these distributions is mainly characterized by their Fourier spectra. ## Blue-noise, anisotropy, no peaks ## )

All these methods aim at generating distributions with the best blue-noise spectra, but we could need other type of distributions.



== Previous works: General Noise Methods

Since two years, some methods proposed to generate sampling distributions accordingly to a given Fourier spectrum.
They allow to generate distributions with the best properties needed for a particular application.



== Previous works: Tile-based Methods

Most of these advanced sampling methods have a strong complexity and thus are rarely used in applications due to large computation times.
Tile-based methods aim at reducing sampling complexity while producing good sampling distributions.
The core idea of these methods is to store the sampling distribution through a hierarchical and non-periodic tiling system.
( Then the sampling is reconstructed by generating the tiling during the runtime. )

These tilings come from previous tile-based methods.
The red dots are the barycenters of each tiles.
The Fourier spectrum of these barycenters contain a lot of peaks that express pattern and regularities in the tiling.
In the right part of the spectrum, these peaks are circled.
Even after optimization of these barycenters, the more important spectral peaks will still remain because of the inherent regularities of the tiling.
( This is the main problem we solved in this work. )



== Previous works: Positioning

To sum up, we propose an sampling methods that overcome drawbacks of previous tile-based methods
and that can generate sampling distribution equivalent to the best state-of-the-art sampling methods in term of quality.
We can also produce distributions with user-specified fourier spectra as with General Noise methods.



== Outline

To achieve our goal, we need a hierarchical tiling system, non-periodic and free of strong regularities.
This tiling must support a sampling system with spectral control.



== Base lattice

The basis of our system is a hexagonal lattice that provide better anisotropy and simpler connectivity than rectangular lattice.
We combine it to a recursive subdivision scheme based on centered hexagonal numbers that allow to densify the lattice.
From this lattice we can construct a hierarchical non-periodic tiling system...



== Polyhexes & Subdivision
-- Polyhexes catalog

...by enumerating all possible fixed trihexes.
A trihex is a group of three connected hexagons.

-- Subdivision rule

From each such trihex, we create a quasi-trihex using hexagonal subdivision, followed by clustering the constituent hexagons into further trihexes.
Please see the paper for more detail about this step.
All these rules form a closed and finite subdivision system that can produces a hierarchical and non-periodic tiling.



== Comparison with previous works

The Fourier spectrum of this tiling's barycenters has a better anisotropy compare to tiling from previous tile-based methods.
( This is due to hexagonal lattice and a greater variety of tiles. )
But we still have some pattern/regularities as shown by the spectral peaks circled in red.
Because the tiling come from multiple subdivision of tiles, some alignment arise on the borders of the previous levels of tiles.
And it is enough to generate harmful spectral peaks.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: hex

To overcome this issue, we introduce some randomness in the basis lattice by shuffling the hexagons' borders at each subdivision.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: hextile

We first define hextiles as group of hexagons.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: triple edge modifiers

And we consider triple-edge modifiers made of three connected borders.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: one TEM

Each of these triple-edge modifiers...



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: one TEM + words litteral

...is characterized by three binary words. A one bit in these words induces a local modification of the hextile border.


== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: one TEM + random words

A stochastic process randomly selects these binary words from a set of admissible triple-edge modifiers, which enforces preservation of the underlying hexatile tiling.
You can find details in the paper.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: TEM + random words

Thus we define a finite set of random TEMs that cover the plane through bi-periodicity.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: irregular hextile

This set of TEMs produce irregular hextiles...



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: irregular hextile lattice

... that form a quasi-hexagonal lattice.



== Irregular Polyhex
-- Irregular Polyhexes catalog

As before, we can enumerate all possible fixed irregular trihexes on this lattice.

-- Irregular Subdivision rule

And for each of them, construct a subdivision rule.



== Comparison with previous works

By applying this set of deterministic subdivision rules, we achieve our goal of creating a non-periodic hierarchical tiling.
The distribution of tiles barycenters is now free of spectral peaks and it's almost isotropic.
Thus, this tiling system is a good base to build a high quality sampling system.



== Sampling generation (video)

To construct a sampling distribution we start with an irregular trihex, that we subdivide enough to the desired density.
From this tiling, we take the barycenters of all tiles.
( It produce a basic sample distribution with good spectral characteristics. )



== Sampling optimization: offset vectors

To reach the desired spectral target, we need to optimize the barycenters.
These local offsets are sufficient to greatly model the spectrum to our desire.



== Sampling optimization: local optimization

From each irregular trihex in our library and their possible neighbors, we generate a collection of patches characterized by unique structural indices.
Each such patch contains a set of tile centroids to be optimized, after which the offset between the basis position and the optimized one, is stored in a lookup table sorted by structural indices.
You can find detail on how this structural index is construct in the paper.



== Sampling optimization: multiple spectral target

Thus, for a different spectral target, a different lookup table is produced.



== Results Tile-based

Compare to previous tile-based methods, this system produce blue-noise distribution of much better quality without spectral peaks.



== Results Blue noise

In fact, for blue-noise sampling, we produce distribution of equivalent quality than best state of the art blue-noise methods.



== Results Step noise

We can also produce more specific distribution as with a general noise method.



== Results Forest

This spectral control allow to mimic existing distribution of a forest for example.



== Results Timing

In term of speed, more than a million points per seconds can be generate as previous tile-based methods.



== Results Adaptive (video)

From the hierarchical nature of the tiling system, it is possible to generate adaptive sampling accordingly to a density function.



== Overall Pipeline

To resume the whole system.
A precomputation phase is needed to construct a set of subdivision rules that allow to generate a hierarchical non-periodic tiling.
These tiling barycenters produce a basic sample distribution that are optimized to fit a user-specified spectral target.
The offset vectors obtain from this optimization are then stored in a lookup table.

The runtime is very fast:
The tiling is generated at the desired density;
Precomputed offsets vectors are added to the barycenters of each tiles;



== Contributions

In this work, our contribution are:
A novel tiling system that is hierarchical, non-periodic and free of spectral peaks;
A novel sampling system that is fast and can generate adaptive distributions with a control over its spectral characteristics.
