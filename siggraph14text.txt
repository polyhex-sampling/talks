== Title

Good morning everyone.
I'll present you a novel tiled-based sampling method that can generate point distribution with arbitrary user-specified spectra.
This work is the result of collaboration of people from French lab CNRS-LIRIS, Stanford and Caltech.



== Problem Statement

Basically, sampling is a process of discretization of a continuous function.
Intuitively, we want the samples to be evenly distributed and to have a local density of samples proportional to the local value of the function.
Also, The characteristics of the distribution of samples have a big impact on the quality of further treatment applied on the samples, such as reconstruction, integral evaluation, etc.



== Why is it essential?

For example, local lack of samples generates a noisy reconstruction as shown left image.
Another issue is the aliasing, resulting from interference between regularities in sampling and regularities in the function, as shown on the right.



== Context
-- Regular sampling

The simplest way to generate sample positions is to calculate a rectangular grid.
This method has the advantage of sampling the whole space uniformly.
But it produces strong aliasing artifacts when the sampling frequency is smaller than twice the characteristic frequency present in the function.
It is well known that the Fourier transform of a rectangular grid is also a rectangular grid of peaks.

-- Random sampling

Another simple solution would be to choose random position for each sample.
This way all frequencies are equally sampled, as can be seen by the constant Fourier spectrum.
But this distribution doesn't guarantee a good uniformity and creates local holes and heaps of samples.
This leads to noisy images after reconstruction and/or integration.



== Previous works: Advanced Methods
-- Poisson Disk

Since nineteen-eighties, a lot of algorithms have been proposed to enhance the sampling quality for a constant number of samples.
In Poisson Disk methods, a random sample position is chosen, while respecting minimum point-to-point distance constraint.
This method guarantees much better uniformity, compared to random sampling.

-- Optimization based

Another class of methods is based on optimization.
The core of these methods is the minimization of an energy function associated to the samples.
Currently, the best-quality sampling distribution are obtained with this class of methods.
Notice that, in spectral domain, there is no frequency peaks, thus limiting aliasing artifacts.

( All these methods use spatial characteristics to generate sampling.
The quality of these distributions is mainly characterized by their Fourier spectra. ## Blue-noise, anisotropy, no peaks ## )

All these methods aim at generating distributions with the best blue-noise spectra, but we may need other type of distributions as well.



== Previous works: General Noise Methods

Since two years, some methods have been proposed to generate sampling distributions with user-specified Fourier spectra.
They allow to generate distributions with the best properties needed for particular applications.



== Previous works: Tile-based Methods

Most of these advanced sampling methods are not suitable for practical application due to their complexity and low speed.
Tile-based methods aim at reducing sampling complexity while producing good sampling distributions.
The core idea of these methods is to store the sampling distribution through a hierarchical and non-periodic tiling system.

The tilings shown in this slide come from prior-art tile-based methods.
The red dots are the barycenters of each tiles.
The Fourier spectrum of these barycenters contain a lot of peaks, highlighted by circle, that express pattern and regularities in the tilings.
Even after optimization of the samples' positions, spectral peaks still remain because of the inherent regularities of the tiling.
( This is the main problem we solved in this work. ) ## central point to emphase ##



== Previous works: Positioning

In this work, we propose a sampling method that overcomes drawbacks of previous tile-based methods
and that can generate sampling distribution equivalent to the best state-of-the-art sampling methods in term of quality.
We can also produce distributions with user-specified Fourier spectra as with General Noise methods.



== Outline

To achieve our goal, we need a hierarchical tiling system, non-periodic and free of strong regularities.
This tiling must support a sampling system with spectral control.

Lets see now the details of the proposed system.



== Base lattice

The building blocks of our system are hexagons that provide better anisotropy and simpler connectivity than squares.
We recursively subdivide each hexagon into smaller hexagons, thus densify the underlying lattice.
This hexagonal lattice is used to build a more complex hierarchical non-periodic tiling system.



== Polyhexes & Subdivision
-- Polyhexes catalog

We group hexagons into connected triplets, which are called trihexes.
We eumerate all possible geometric configurations, shown here.

-- Subdivision rule

For each trihex, we subdivide constituent hexagons, followed by clustering them into further trihexes.
Please see the paper for more detail about this step.
All these rules form a closed and finite subdivision system that can produces a hierarchical and non-periodic tiling.



== Comparison with previous works

The Fourier spectrum of this tiling is more isotropic compared to previous tile-based methods.
This is due to hexagonal lattice and a greater variety of tiles.
But we still have small spectral peaks pattern/regularities as shown by the spectral peaks circled in red.
Because our tiling is generated by applying recursive subdivision scheme, some alignments arise on the borders of the previous levels of tiles.
It is enough to generate small but still harmful spectral peaks.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: hex

To overcome this issue, we introduce some randomness in the basis lattice by shuffling the hexagons' borders at each subdivision.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: hextile

We first define hextiles as group of hexagons.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: triple edge modifiers

And we consider triple-edge modifiers made of three connected borders.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: one TEM

Each of these triple-edge modifiers...



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: one TEM + words litteral

...is characterized by three binary words. A one bit in these words induces a local modification of the hextile border.


== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: one TEM + random words

A stochastic process randomly selects these binary words from a set of admissible triple-edge modifiers, which enforces preservation of the underlying hextile tiling.
You can find details in the paper.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: TEM + random words

Thus we define a finite set of random TEMs that cover the plane through bi-periodicity.



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: irregular hextile

This set of TEMs produce irregular hextiles...



== Irregular quasi-hexagonal lattice: irregular hextile lattice

... that form a quasi-hexagonal lattice.



== Irregular Polyhex
-- Irregular Polyhexes catalog

As before, we can enumerate all possible fixed irregular trihexes on this lattice.

-- Irregular Subdivision rule

And for each of them, construct a subdivision rule.



== Comparison with previous works

By applying this set of deterministic subdivision rules, we achieve our goal of creating a non-periodic hierarchical tiling.
The distribution of tiles barycenters is now free of spectral peaks and it's almost isotropic.
Thus, this tiling system is a good base to build a high quality sampling system.



== Sampling generation (video)

To construct a sampling distribution we start with an irregular trihex, that we subdivide enough to the desired density.
From this tiling, we take the barycenters of all tiles.



== Sampling optimization: offset vectors

To reach the desired spectral target, we need to optimize the barycenters.
These local offsets are sufficient to shape the spectrum to desired profile.



== Sampling optimization: local optimization

From each irregular trihex in our library and their possible neighbors, we generate a collection of patches characterized by unique structural indices.
Each such patch contains a set of tile centroids to be optimized.
The offset between the basis position and the optimized one, is stored in a lookup table sorted by structural indices.
You can find detail on how this structural index is construct in the paper.



== Sampling optimization: multiple spectral target

For different spectral targets, different lookup tables are produced.



== Results Tile-based

Compare to previous tile-based methods, this system produces blue-noise distributions of much better quality and without spectral peaks.



== Results Blue noise

In fact, for blue-noise sampling, we produce distributions of equivalent quality than best state-of-the-art blue-noise methods.



== Results Step noise

We can also produce more specific distributions as with a general noise method.



== Results Forest

This spectral control allow to mimic existing distribution of a forest for example.



== Results Timing

In term of speed, more than a million of points per seconds can be generated as with previous tile-based methods.



== Results Adaptive (video)

Thanks to hierarchical nature of the tiling system, it's possible to generate adaptive sampling which is locally proportional to a density function.



== Overall Pipeline

In summary,
A precomputation phase is needed.

 to construct a set of subdivision rules that allows to generate a hierarchical non-periodic tiling.
These tiling barycenters produce a basic sample distribution that are optimized to fit a user-specified spectral target.
The offset vectors obtain from this optimization are then stored in a lookup table.

The runtime is very fast:
The tiling is generated at the desired density;
Precomputed offsets vectors are added to the barycenters of each tiles;



== Contributions

Lets summarize our contributions:

First, a novel hierarchical, non-periodic tiling system is proposed.
The key property of this system is absence of spectral peaks.

Seconds, a novel sampling system is proposed which generate adaptive distributions with control over their spectral characteristics.
